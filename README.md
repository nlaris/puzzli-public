**Note:** The code in this repo is not up to date with what's reflected on the live Puzzli website. This was the initial version (classic mode only) that I worked on with the intent of getting more familiar with this specific tech stack. What started as a practice problem became a passion project that I've optimized and built out. 🙂

# Puzzli

Play Puzzli at [puzzligame.com](https://puzzligame.com/)

Puzzli is based on a tiling puzzle game, [IZZI](https://www.thinkfun.com/products/izzi/), in which the player must arrange 64 tiles in an 8x8 grid such that the edges of each tile match in color. Puzzli simplifies this concept by selecting 9 random IZZI tiles, challenging players to arrange them in a 3x3 grid instead. 

Each day, Puzzli generates a new puzzle, offering endless variations (no more than 120 million, actually) of a mini IZZI puzzle.
